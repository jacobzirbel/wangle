# wangle

Front end code of [Wangle Waypoints](https://randomwayfarer.com/home) stripped down to remove sensitive data.

## OBJECTIVE
Help avid fishermen manage and visualize their fishing data and waypoints. A user might have hundreds of waypoints saved on their GPS/Depth Finder. Using Wangle, they can upload their data and sort waypoints into lists. Then they can download a file with selected waypoints that they want to include on their device for their next outing, while the rest are stored online.
